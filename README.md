### Now for a little internet optimism

Open with intent - we welcome contributions - we want pull requests and to hear about issues.

### What is at_dude?

This secure, peer-to-peer application allows you to send 'dudes' to your contacts! The longer you press and hold the Dude button,
the longer your sent dude will be! Keep up-to-date with your 'dude' stats to see how much duding you've done!

### Would you like to contribute?

We are always open to Pull Requests! If you see something that could use fixing or if you see a possible feature that can be added, 
feel free to raise a Pull Request! If you'd like to learn more about contributing to our open source projects on atsign-foundation,
